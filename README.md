# Project go-project-template

Template for go projects generated by [go-blueprint](https://github.com/Melkeydev/go-blueprint) customized by me to include [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) live reloading through docker!

## Getting Started

Open `docker-compose.yaml` and change `taget: dev` to `target: prod` if you want to disable live reloading when using docker - start with `make run-docker`

## MakeFile

Run build make command with tests
```bash
make all
```

Build the application
```bash
make build
```

Run the application
```bash
make run
```
Create DB container
```bash
make docker-run
```

Shutdown DB Container
```bash
make docker-down
```

DB Integrations Test:
```bash
make itest
```

Live reload the application:
```bash
make watch
```

Run the test suite:
```bash
make test
```

Clean up binary from the last build:
```bash
make clean
```
